				We have implemented Better Bookstore, an application aimed at providing students with cheap and easy access to college textbooks.
				The application aims to connect the buyer to the seller through an online service to minimize the financial losses associated with buying textbooks.
				Without getting too much into the economics of the situation, we are basically enabling buyers and sellers of textbooks to meet in the middle of the current buy and sell points through an exchange-type system.
				This will lower the price for textbook buyers, and raise the selling point of book sellers, meaning those who benefit most from transactions through our website are the users.
				On top of that, the Better Bookstore allows users to buy and sell course documents, such as previous homeworks and midterm exams, allowing students to be best prepared for the class that they are taking.
				In general, our goal for the Better Bookstore is to ease the stress and financial burden of being a college student, allowing students to focus more on course content rather than the money or time it takes to get the proper course materials.
